Welcome to Technology class. You should have already joined this class on Google Classroom. Here's what we'll be doing today.

1. Learn what tech class is all about.
2. Play a couple of short games to get to know each other.
3. Set up some files and accounts for this class.
4. Brainstorm ideas for a class website.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
