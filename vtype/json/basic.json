  "The \"home row\" is made up of the keys, asdf and jkl;. You should keep your fingers on the home row as you type, and only move them to reach a nearby key. That way, you will move your fingers less, and you will be able to type faster once you get used to it. This technique might seem slower at first, but you'll get used to it.",

  "The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is the second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.",

  "Turtles are reptiles characterized by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield. \"Turtle\" may refer to the order as a whole (American English) or to fresh-water and sea-dwelling testudines (British English). The order Testudines includes both living and extinct species. The earliest known members of this group date from 220 million years ago, making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or crocodilians. Of the 356 know species alive today, some are highly endangered.",

  "Debussy was experimental from the beginning, favouring dissonances and intervals that were not taught at the Academy. He was a brilliant pianist and an outstanding sight reader, who could have had a professional career if he wanted. The pieces he played in public at this time included sonata movements by Beethoven, Schumann, and Weber. During the summers of 1880, 1881, and 1882, he accompanied Nadezhda von Meck, the wealthy patron of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, as she travelled with her family in Europe. The young composer's many musical activities during these vacations included playing four-hand pieces with von Meck at the piano, giving music lessons to her children, and performing in private concerts with some of her musician friends."
