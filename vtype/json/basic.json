  "The \"home row\" is made up of the keys, asdf and jkl;. You should keep your fingers on the home row as you type, and only move them to reach a nearby key. That way, you will move your fingers less, and you will be able to type faster once you get used to it. This technique might seem slower at first, but you'll get used to it.",
