  "Welcome to technology class. One of the goals for this class is for everyone to improve their typing speed. Along the way, you will also learn about spreadsheets and graphs by tracking your typing data using Google Sheets. When you are done typing this paragraph, it will automatically take you to a new page where you will see how many words you type per minute. Don't close that page, because you will need to record that score in a Google Sheet. You can go back to the instructions page and find how to create and format your Google Sheet to start recording your typing data.",

  "What is Scratch? With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations and share your creations with others in the online community. Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Essential skills for life in the 21st century. Today, you are going to create a Scratch account, and make a cat dance. After that, there are a lot of possibilities.",

  "Today, we will be learning about a computer language, called HTML. It stands for hypertext markup language, and it is the language you use to make a website. Everything from Google Sites to Amazon.com uses HTML. It is quite handy to know. We will sign up for an account at thimble.mozilla.org, where we can start writing HTML. We will also talk about passwords, since we will need to create one to sign up for Thimble. We will spend most of our class time learning about HTML and what resources are available to help you learn."
