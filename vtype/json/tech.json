  "Welcome to technology class. One of the goals for this class is for everyone to improve their typing speed. Along the way, you will also learn about spreadsheets and graphs by tracking your typing data using Google Sheets. When you are done typing this paragraph, it will automatically take you to a new page where you will see how many words you type per minute. Don't close that page, because you will need to record that score in a Google Sheet. You can go back to the instructions page and find how to create and format your Google Sheet to start recording your typing data.",
  "What is Scratch? Here is some information from the Scratch website: With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations and share your creations with others in the online community. Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Essential skills for life in the 21st century. Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is provided free of charge."
