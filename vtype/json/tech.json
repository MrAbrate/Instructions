  "Welcome to technology class. One of the goals for this class is for everyone to improve their typing speed. Along the way, you will also learn about spreadsheets and graphs by tracking your typing data using Google Sheets. When you are done typing this paragraph, it will automatically take you to a new page where you will see how many words you type per minute. Don't close that page, because you will need to record that score in a Google Sheet. You can go back to the instructions page and find how to create and format your Google Sheet to start recording your typing data.",

  "What is Scratch? With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations and share your creations with others in the online community. Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Essential skills for life in the 21st century. Today, you are going to create a Scratch account, and make a cat dance. After that, there are a lot of possibilities.",

  "Today, we will be learning about a computer language, called HTML. It stands for hypertext markup language, and it is the language you use to make a website. Everything from Google Sites to Amazon.com uses HTML. It is quite handy to know. We will sign up for an account at thimble.mozilla.org, where we can start writing HTML. We will also talk about passwords, since we will need to create one to sign up for Thimble. We will spend most of our class time learning about HTML and what resources are available to help you learn.",

  "You have all been doing a great job so far. We'll be doing an online course together at Codecademy.com. You can work with a partner or by yourself. This will be a really good foundation for us to start making things with HTML. After this typing exercise, there will be another one. Put your fingers on the home row and DON'T LOOK AT THEM.",

  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Did you know that sentence has all 26 letters in the alphabet? Let's try it again. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog! That's a pretty good sentence for typing practice. Today we are going to learn about Typography, also known as, the style and appearance of printed matter. We will also discuss the class website, and how we will be adding to it over the semester.",

  "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code you use to style your webpage. How do I make my text black or red? How do I make my content show up in such-and-such a place on the screen? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors? Like HTML, CSS is not really a programming language. It is not a markup language either. It is a style sheet language. This means that it lets you apply styles selectively to elements in HTML documents.",

  "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, also know as CRISPR is a new technology that could one day be used to edit the DNA of living organisms. Viruses make us sick, but they also attack bacteria, which have developed the ability to recognize hostile virus DNA and destroy it. Scientists have figured out how to teach the bacteria to recognize any piece of DNA and, instead of destroying it, replace it with new information. People are already thinking of ways to use CRISPR to cure diseases, stop mosquitoes from reproducing, or even change things like eye color in people!",

  "Amazon's Alexa can now send SMS text messages, but only if you have an Android Phone. It's the company's latest attempt to turn the voice-assistant devices from hubs for audible entertainment to full-fledged communication tools. It announced the new feature on Tuesday. If your hands are full but you want a buddy to know you're running late, say \"Alexa, text Bob,\" and then dictate your message. The recipient needs to be in your phone's contact list. Amazon says Alexa will then \"find the best way to send the message.\" It might go out as SMS or through the existing Alexa messaging service.",

  "Today, you will be working with a partner to plan an instruction video using iMovie. You will have the next week to complete this assignment. We will be sharing these videos, so make sure that you keep this in mind as you plan your topics. After we create these videos, we will work in larger teams to design and build webpages using HTML. These webpages will be combined to form a giant 6th grade vikings website that everyone in the school can view.",
